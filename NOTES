Rough sketch of the setup:

Two components:
    (I) lsnd.py:
	Python script.

	Runs as a new user; all relevant mail is forwarded to this user.

	Works through its mailqueue.

	On getting a new game request: start a new game with the hotseat
	automaton, send out results files to the players.

	On getting a turnfile: put it in appropriate Orders/ dir. If it
	completes a set, start up a new instance of the hotseat automaton if
	necessary, wait for the results files, and mail them out.

	Keep only N hotseat automatons alive at a time, killing judiciously
	chosen ones to make room.

    (II) lsnautomaton.sh:
	Bash script. Given a game number, it
	    Hacks a copy of LSNClient.exe to use the game number for hotseat
	    play, and runs it in a new Xvfb;

	    Starts a hotseat game with parameters prescribed by a file in the
	    game dir;

	    Iteratively: waits for orders files to appear, chmods them -w, and
	    executes the current turn with null orders (note this is slightly
	    tricky to automate for deployment turns!).

	    While waiting for an orders file, it keeps the LSN process
	    suspended.

	    Recognises end-of-game, and handles it appropriately.
