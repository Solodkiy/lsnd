Simple instructions for setting up a relaying SMTP server in windows
====================================================================

Download hMailServer from www.hmailserver.com. These instructions are based on
version 5.3.

Install it, accepting all defaults.

Enter a password when it asks, then have it start the 'administrator' when it
offers to.

In the administrator, hit 'connect'.

On the left, select Advanced->IP Ranges, then double-click on 'internet'.

Under "Allow deliveries", deselect everything.

Now select 'My computer' under Advanced->IP Ranges, ensure that "Allow
deliveries from: external to external" is ticked, but "require SMTP
authentication: external to external" is *not* ticked.

If you're lucky, your ISP is not blocking outgoing connections to SMTP
servers, and you should now be done. But probably you're not lucky, and you'll
have to set the server to forward mail via your ISP's server.

To do this, go to Settings->Protocols->SMTP->Delivery of e-mail, and put the
details of your ISP's SMTP server there. This is most likely something like
"smtp.yourisp.com", port 25, and maybe some authentication details.

Hopefully, all will now work.

Please test that you are not now running an open relay - see
