	<p>lsnd is an ad-hoc server for <a
	    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_Squad_Nemesis">Laser
	    Squad Nemesis</a>, which I hacked up as a stop-gap solution after
	the official server went down.</p>
	<p>I have an instance running on my own machine - <a
	    href="USAGE">information on how to use it</a>.</p>

	<p>You can download the <a href="lsnd.tgz">source</a>, or clone it
	from its <a href="http://gitorious.org/lsnd">gitorious repo</a>, if
	you're interested in seeing how it works. Using it to set up your own
	server would likely require a fair amount of experimentation and
	fiddling - I suggest you contact me directly if you want to do that,
	and I'll give some guidance.</p>
