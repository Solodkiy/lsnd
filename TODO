Optimising reconstruction process
    Might be able to overwrite turn 1 or 2 with later turnfiles, if also edit
    the turn in the orders files?

    Also, it looks like preserving more files will make the wine hack
    redundant.

Mods
    Can we just edit the data in the turn 0/1 files, and not require the
    players to edit their config files?
